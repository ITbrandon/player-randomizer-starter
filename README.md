# PLAYER RANDOMIZER

## Instructions
Try to optimize, improve, or extend the code for this.

- Add styles
  - focus on:
    - classList selectors in js
- Add more player information
  - could use nested loops
  - more complex data
  - generate data from an api?
- Add error handling
  - test bugs and create better error messages (throw new Error(), console.error(), throw error, try /catch block)
- Make it more readable
  - refactor the code
- DRY code out (Dont Repeat Yourself)
  - refactor and remove redunancy
  - extend functions
- Ability to create new players
  - add a form and make it so you can upload, remove, and/or edit characters

  ### My Feature:

  - New Player
   - I added a button that will generate a new player and give it a name I was able also to make sure that names never were put twice so all names are 100% unique. You can check out the code near the bottom of the main.js
